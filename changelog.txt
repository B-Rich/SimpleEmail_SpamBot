---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# quick_bot.py v0.1
* advanced.py is supposed to be used quickly. Simply type in your email, password, target's email, set a delay (default is 0) and done!
* advanced.py is pretty much the same as quick_bot.py at the moment but it's more pain in the ass, v0.4 is gonna channge a lot of stuff and have some new features.
* quick_bot.py won't have any updates (maybe). I don't want to mess it up!

# quick_bot.py v0.2 MIGHT HAVE:
* Support for Outlook and iCloud.
* Multiple targets
