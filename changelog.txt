# SESB normal.py v0.1:
* SimpleEmail_SpamBot

# SESB normal.py v0.2:
* Added delay feature.


# SESB normal.py v0.3:
* No need to add "@gmail.com", just type in your username.
* Changed more stuff.

# SESB normal.py v0.3.4:
* Changed some stuff

# SESB advanced.py 0.1
* advanced.py is supposed to be used quickly. Simply type in your email, password, target's email, set a delay (default is 0) and done!
* normal.py is pretty much the same as advanced.py at the moment but it's more pain in the ass,v0.4 is gonna channge a lot of stuff and have some new features.
* advanced.py won't have any updates (maybe). I don't want to mess it up!
