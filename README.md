# SimpleEmail_SpamBot
Just a simple email spam bot written in python3. The respositroy name says it all.

<<<<<<< HEAD
```SESB``` = ```v0.8```. 
[See what's new.](https://github.com/DizAzTor/SimpleEmail_SpamBot/blob/master/changelog/changelog.md#v08)
=======
## A little update:
0. 0.8 is indeed coming. I'm not going to delete this repo, heh.
1. I might change the name later. Because I'll make it an email client.
2. I'll add a GUI as well. An email client with CLI and GUI.
3. 0.8 fixes some stuff too.

Also, It seems like someone has forked this repo. I don't know why or what they're going to do with it, but cool :3.

### KNOWN ISSUES:
1. whoops
```python
elif command == "set message":
    try:
        # yes.
        spam_subject = raw_input("\nMESSAGE>>> ")

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nStopped.")

    except EOFError:
        print("\nStopped.")

    self.command_line()
            
```
2. uh yeah

```python
print("\nDELAY SET TO: %d" % spam_delay)
TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not str
```

### What will happen to SESB?
I do not know lel. I will add some new stuff later, just working on something else.

```SESB.py``` = ```v0.7```
