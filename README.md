# SimpleEmail_SpamBot
Just a simple email spam bot written in Python when i was really bored. The respositroy name says it all.

```normal.py``` = ```v0.3.4```
```advanced.py``` = ```v0.1```

### What's the difference between ```advanced.py``` and ```normal.py```?
* ```advanced.py``` is supposed to be used quickly. Simply type in your email, password, target's email, set a delay (default is **```0```**) and done!
* ```normal.py``` is pretty much the same as ```advanced.py``` **at the moment** but it's more pain in the ass,```v0.4``` is gonna channge a lot of stuff and have some new features.
* ```advanced.py``` won't have any updates (maybe). I don't want to mess it up!
* ##### TL;DR: **use** ```advanced.py```



### Make sure to do these things before running the script.

* Go to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and turn it on. This script won't work if it's turned off.

* If you're using Windows, then install Python 2. If you're using Linux/MacOS, then i'm assuming you already have it installed.
