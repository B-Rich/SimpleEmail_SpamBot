# SimpleEmail_SpamBot
Just a simple email spam bot written in Python when i was really bored. The respositroy name says it all.

```SESB.py``` = ```v0.4```
```quick_bot.py``` = ```v0.1```

### What's the difference between ```SESB.py``` and ```quick_bot.py```?
* ```advanced.py``` is supposed to be used quickly. Simply type in your email, password, target's email, set a delay (default is **```0```**) and done!
* ```quick_bot.py``` won't have any updates (maybe). I don't want to mess it up!

### Make sure to do these things before running the script:
#### GMAIL
* Go to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1 and enable it

#### Outlook
* Go to https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/popandimap and enable POP and IMAP

#### iCloud
* Read https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397

#### DOWNLOAD AS .ZIP

#### Windows:
0. Go to where you downloaded the zip file and unzip it.
10. Go to "SimpleEmail_SpamBot"
11. Open a terminal in that location.
100. Type ```C:\Python27\python SESB.py``` in the terminal and press ENTER.
101. Done!
